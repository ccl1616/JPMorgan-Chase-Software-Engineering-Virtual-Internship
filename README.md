# JPMorgan-Chase-Software-Engineering-Virtual-Internship
This repo contains all the submitted files of tasks from [JPMorgan Chase & Co. Software Engineering Virtual Internship](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/R5iK7HMxJGBgaSbvk/JP-Morgan-Banking-Technology-Virtual-Program). The visualization of charts and data analysis our trader’s see is all built on JPMorgan Chase's own open sourced software called Perspective. 

I finished this project and got the certificate on June 20, 2022.
